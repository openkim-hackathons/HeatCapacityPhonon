        Estimate constant-pressure heat capacity and linear thermal expansion tensor with finite-difference numerical
        derivatives.

        Section 3.2 in https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp909762j argues that the centered finite-difference approach
        is more accurate than fluctuation-based approaches for computing heat capacities from molecular-dynamics
        simulations.

        The finite-difference approach requires to run at least three molecular-dynamics simulations with a fixed number
        of atoms N at constant pressure (P) and at different constant temperatures T (NPT ensemble), one at the target
        temperature at which the heat capacity and thermal expansion tensor are to be estimated, one at a slightly lower
        temperature, and one at a slightly higher temperature. It is possible to add more temperature points
        symmetrically around the target temperature for higher-order finite-difference schemes.

        This test driver repeats the unit cell of the zero-temperature crystal structure to build a supercell and then
        runs molecular-dynamics simulations in the NPT ensemble using Lammps.

        This test driver uses kim_convergence to detect equilibrated molecular-dynamics simulations. It checks for the
        convergence of the volume, temperature, enthalpy and cell shape parameters every rlc_run_length timesteps.

        After the molecular-dynamics simulations, the symmetry of the average structures during the equilbrated parts of
        the runs are checked to ensure that they did not change in comparison to the initial structure. Also, it is
        ensured that replicated atoms in replicated unit atoms are not too far away from the average atomic positions.

        The crystals might melt or vaporize during the simulations. In that case, kim-convergence would only detect
        equilibration after unnecessarily long simulations. Therefore, this test driver initially check for melting or
        vaporization during short initial simulations. During these initial runs, the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of
        atoms during the simulations is monitored. If the MSD exceeds a given threshold value, an error is raised.

        All output files are written to the given output directory.

        :param timestep_ps:
            Time step in picoseconds.

        :type timestep_ps: float
        :param target_size:
            Target number of atoms in the supercell to build by repeating the unit cell. Uses cutoff-based expansion
            with target size constraint (good for non-cubic cells). The algorithm starts with an 20Å cutoff radius and
            recursively decreases it until the supercell has fewer atoms than target_size.
            Default is 10000.
            Should be bigger than zero.
            Ignored if repeat is specified.
        :type target_size: int
        :param repeat:
            Tuple of three integers specifying how often to repeat the unit cell in each direction to build the
            supercell.
            If None, the repeat will be determined based on the target_size argument using a cutoff-based approach.
            Default is None.

            Number of timesteps to monitor the mean-squared displacement in Lammps.
            Before the mean-squared displacement is monitored, the system will be equilibrated for the same number of
            timesteps.
            Default is 20000 timesteps.
            Should be bigger than zero and a multiple of thermo_sampling_period.

            Random seeds for the Lammps simulations.
            This has to be a sequence of 2 * number_symmetric_temperature_steps + 1 integers for the different
            temperatures being simulated.
            If None is given, random seeds will be sampled.
            Default is (1, 2, 3).
            Each seed should be bigger than zero.
        :type random_seeds: Optional[Sequence[int]]
        :param rlc_n_every:

        :type equilibration_plots: bool
        :param temperature_step_fraction:
            Fraction of the target temperature that is used as temperature step for the finite-difference scheme.
            For example, if the target temperature is 300 K and the temperature_step_fraction is 0.1, the temperature
            difference between the different NPT simulations will be 30 K.
            Should be bigger than zero and smaller than one divided by number_symmetric_temperature_steps (to avoid
            simulations at negative temperatures).

        :param number_symmetric_temperature_steps:
            Number of symmetric temperature steps around the target temperature to use for the finite-difference
            scheme.

            T - 2*delta_T, T - delta_T, T, T + delta_T, T + 2*delta_T, where delta_T is determined by

            Maximum number of parallel workers to use for running Lammps simulations at different temperatures.
            If None is given, this will be set to 1.
            This is independent of the number of processors used by each Lammps simulation that can be specified in the
            lammps command itself.
            Default is None.
